												<h3>MATERIAL EVIDENCE 4</h3>
												<p>
In the weeks preceeding 25/03/22 we had been serving schools letters saying to Cease & Desist injecting schoolchildren with unknown substances. On 25/03/22 c. 14:50 after our Pushback at Fosse Park Leicester, we split up me to make my way to the house of a friend. I heard the noise of a siren and saw in the rear view mirror an unliveried police car and pulled left to let it pass. The car swerved in front of me with others surrounding me. I was told i was being stopped about having no insurance. There were by now 4 vehicles including two unliveried and c. 8 police men. They threatened my property real, corporeal and intangible. i was told i was being arrested for driving and then also being arrested for harassing schools. i was dragged out of car by the handcuffs and lifted in to a 6 vehicle of van--there was no an additional police motorcycle and 11 police men including 2 armed police men.

i was refused paper and pencil. i was told that the visitors to the cell were not to be entered on to the custody record.
i was interrogated for 75minutes--60 of which were about the schools.
i was refused copies of the claims made by the employees of the schools.

i was told i could not keep the PACE leaflet and was shouted at. During my incarceration the communication call button was deactivated and i could not make myself or my requests known. i was left in the middle of nowhere alone after being kept for 8 hours and had no idea where i was. I was told by PC Cole an hour before my release that i would be freed if i agreed to bail conditions of not contacting schools or sending letters re the injections - i explained that i was being told to ignore the harms of the injections and let the harm continue unchallenged which i could not do.

Upon my daughter hearing i thought my hand was broken and seeing my injuries my daughter took me to the Leicester Royal Infirmary approximately 90 minutes after being left to find my way home. I was too swollen for it to be ascertained if my hand was broken.

The 26/03/22 i received a voicemail from a police man saying that they understood i had been injured and to get in touch on a mobile number. I had told only my daughter and the nurse that the police had inflicted the injuries. The message could not be found when i went to play it to my daughter and have her take the details down.

The police and CPS refuse to provide the evidence of all the body cam footage and the interrogation.
i was refused paper and pencil ; And i was refused the custody record. When i was let go i said i wanted to keep the slim leaflet of PACE and the custody sergeant nigh on screamed at me that i could not.

The administration at Leicester Royal Infirmary refuse to supply the SAR. i was told on the night/morning of the 26/03/22 i would need a further xray and exam after 14 days and would be contacted. LRI lost the records and claimed they knew nothing of this.
Immediately after this i was told that Yeomans PC259 was claiming i had assaulted them

Then matters were to be heard at the Magistrates court and i was told, by police, to attend. There has been no correspondence sent to me regarding this.
i went to the Magistrates court and i was told it was unnecessary for me to attend as a Legal Advisor would decide based on papers before them. I can only presume these were police papers only as i had been unaware of this form of 'court'.
Because i objected to this 'court' of 1 side, i was informed it was to be moved to be brought before a judge.
I had still had no case file and the judge told Safina Desai of the CPS to get a copy of their papers to me ; And i was to have a browse before being brought back in. On that day the judge- Thomas shifted the matters up to the Crown Court. i saw for the first time the injuries Yeomans PC259 was claiming i had intentionally inflicted as he and numerous others were laying hands upon my property corporeal and real.
All the while the Subject Access Requests are ignored.

On 02.11.22 we went to court and upon discovering no list with our name the office said there was no hearing just the court deciding some issues. We pressed for the orders from the initial Crown Court hearing and were given the Pr Trial Presentation Hearing Judicial order paper and were told to go to the CPS office to submit our evidence. This evidence was a selection of the injuries photographs. The case manager refused to speak to me. The receptionist refused to accept the photographs 'on orders from her manager'. The CPS have provided no evidence.

On 27.02.23 when going to Leicester Crown Court for c. the 4th such visit since 02.11.22, whilst helping a friend in the office, i was approached by 2 police men. They claimed i had given my details--i had not given my details i said and they left. They returned and used my name and said there was an arrest warrant out for me and after 6 police imprisoning me and taking my property i was taken to a police cell and then back to the Crown Court and then before Robert Alan Brown. i was told there had been a meeting on 19.01.23 which i had failed to attend and the CPS had put a warrant out.

They further claimed i knew about the hearing - which i did not- and that i had not submitted papers on time.
As i told them i have received no papers from the police or CPS and can not defend when there papers are withheld. RABrown called me a liar. RABrown without my consent said all papers were to be emailed to me. I did not consent voluntarily to this. No such method to submit papers to me has been used by the CPS. They did in fact write a 1-page letter contra RABrown's order. The CPS were not sanctioned for failing to present per the PTPHJO. i was then passed some poly pockets of documents and discovered the partial transcript from 25/03/22.

On 27/03/22 we went to Leicester Crown Court to discover that there had been a court hearing 2-weeks earlier and per Steve Taylor of KCH Nottingham, he did not put out an arrest warrant that time with a bemused face for effect. [an arrest warrant for a hearing to which we were obivious]. They all decided that the 27th would not be the start of the 3-day trial [to which we were oblivious] and the listing said "re POSS PONE". It was at 11:48 Steve Taylor first approached us and said he wanted a quiet word with me. I had not identified myself to him but he somehow knew me just as the police somehow knew me on 27/03/23.

It was then Steve Taylor said that in the meeting 14 days prior they had decided not to move ahead. When questioned Steve Taylor said i had assaulted Yeomans PC259 and still the case was not going ahead. Steve Taylor also said that Yeomans PC259 had not said he was arresting me for harassment [which i know he did early on and way before i was dragged from my car as i was trying to write things down but my hands were shaking so badly ]. Within Yeoman's statement he has again switched the mention of arrest for harassment around.
The transcription was short and started 60 minutes in omitting all mention of the 16 claims of harassment received the police man claimed in the last days. The interrogator refused to let me look at the affidavit of claims, or have paper and pencil to write and keep and rebut.</p>
